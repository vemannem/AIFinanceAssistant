A shareholder is a person, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a company’s stock or a share of a mutual fund. Shareholders essentially own the company and this comes with the right to share in the profits. Shareholders benefit from increased stock valuations or profits distributed as dividends when the company is successful. They also have the right to participate in corporate elections. They can lose money as well, however, when the company does and share prices drop. Shareholders can claim any remaining assets after the company's debts are paid if the company fails. Yurle Villegas / Investopedia A shareholder is an entity that owns one or more shares in a company’s stock or a mutual fund. Shareholders are also often called stockholders. Being a shareholder comes with certain rights and responsibilities. A shareholder is also permitted to vote on certain issues that affect the company or the fund in which they hold shares along with sharing in its overall financial success. A single shareholder who owns and controls more than 50% of a company’s outstanding shares is referred to as a majority shareholder. Those who hold less than 50% of a company’s stock are classified as minority shareholders. Most majority shareholders are company founders. Majority shareholders are frequently related to company founders in older, more established firms. They wield considerable power to influence critical operational decisions when they control more than half the voting interest. These issues include replacing board members and C-level executives like chief executive officers (CEOs). Many companies often avoid having majority shareholders among their ranks for this reason. Corporate shareholders aren't personally liable for the company’s debts and other financial obligations. Its creditors can't target a shareholder’s personal assets if the company becomes insolvent. Shareholders are entitled to collect any proceeds that are left over after a company liquidates its assets but creditors, bondholders, and preferred stockholders have precedence over common stockholders who may be left with nothing after all the debts are paid. Being a shareholder comes with certain rights and responsibilities as well as tax implications.",

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) pools a group of securities into a fund and can be traded like an individual stock on an exchange. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds multiple underlying assets. It can be bought and sold on an exchange, much like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of stocks—even specific investment strategies. Various ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, or hedging risk in a portfolio. The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen In the U.S., ETFs must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, except where the rules modify their regulatory requirements. Open-ended funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. Vanguard's Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index and has a minimum investment of $1.00. The fund holds shares of all 105 companies on the index, some more familiar than others because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Procter & Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo. There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after the markets close. Volatility is limited with an ETF because its holdings are diversified across various assets. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors during economic cycles. Online brokers may allow you to invest in a wide variety of ETFs, including the following.",

    "content": "Index funds use a passive investing strategy and trade less frequently to keep costs low. Index funds mirror the performance of benchmarks like the S&P 500 and other market indexes by mimicking their makeup. Index funds invest in the same assets using the same weights as the target index, typically stocks or bonds. Index funds provide broad market exposure and diversification across various sectors and asset classes. These passive investments attract many investors. In 2021, passive index funds tracking market benchmarks accounted for just 21% of the U.S. equity fund market. By 2023, passive index funds had grown to about half of all U.S. fund assets. Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight Investors interested in the stocks of an economic sector or the whole market can find indexes that aim to gain returns that closely match the benchmark index they want to track. The broader index funds can minimize tracking errors, the difference between the fund's performance and the target index. The portfolios of index funds only change substantially when their benchmark indexes change. If the fund follows a weighted index, its managers may periodically rebalance the weights (the percentage by market cap) and components of their fund's securities to keep matched up with the target index. For broad indexes like the S&P 500, it would be impractical or expensive for an investor to construct the right proportions in a portfolio. Index funds do the work by holding a representative sample of the securities. S&P 500 index funds, the most popular and oldest such funds in the U.S., mimic the moves of the stocks in the S&P 500, which covers about 80% of all U.S. equities by market cap. The seismic shift in the rise of passive funds has come as they often convincingly outperform their actively managed peers. According to the widely followed S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards, about 9 out of 10 actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&P 500 benchmark in the past 15 years. Besides the S&P 500, other major indexes followed by such funds include the Nasdaq Composite Index, made up of 3,000 stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange; the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which follows the total U.S. dollar-denominated bond market; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, consisting of 30 large-cap companies chosen by the editors of the Wall Street Journal.

    "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Tracking error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark. It is often used to gauge how well an index fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) replicates the performance of its benchmark. It is also used to measure the performance of actively-managed funds. Tracking error is reported as a standard deviation percentage difference, which reports the difference between the return an investor receives and that of the benchmark they were attempting to imitate. Investopedia / Julie Bang Since portfolio risk is often measured against a benchmark, tracking error is a commonly used metric to gauge how well an investment is performing. Tracking error shows an investment's consistency versus a benchmark over a given period of time. Portfolios indexed to a benchmark may still behave slightly differently from it over time. The measure of tracking error is used to quantify this difference. Tracking error is the standard deviation of the difference between the returns of an investment and its benchmark. Tracking error is calculated by using the sequence of returns for a portfolio and its benchmark: Investors can use tracking error to evaluate portfolio managers. A large tracking error combined with low average returns suggests issues with the investment, often prompting investors to seek alternatives. It may also be used to forecast performance, particularly for quantitative portfolio managers who construct risk models that include the likely factors that influence price changes. The managers then construct a portfolio that uses the type of constituents of a benchmark (such as style, leverage, momentum, or market cap) to create a portfolio that will have a tracking error that closely adheres to the benchmark. Index fund net asset values (NAVs) tend to be lower than benchmarks because funds have fees, unlike the index itself. A high expense ratio can significantly harm a fund's performance. Fund managers can offset high fees and outperform the index through effective rebalancing, dividend management, or securities lending. Beyond fund fees, a number of other factors can affect a fund's tracking error. One important factor is the extent to which a fund's holdings match the holdings of the underlying index or benchmark. Funds often contain a sample of securities that managers believe represent the index. There are frequently also differences in weighting between a fund's assets and the assets of the index.",

    "content": "A bond is a fixed-income investment issued by governments or corporations to raise funding. A bond, which is offered by most brokerage platforms, is a fixed-income investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a specified interest rate for a predetermined period. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. Investopedia / Ellen Lindner Bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure projects. Corporations often borrow to grow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or hire employees. Bonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the loan terms, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date by which the bond principal must be repaid. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning money to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is the coupon rate. The initial price of most bonds is typically the par value, or the face value of a bond. The actual market price depends on the issuer's credit quality, the time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender upon maturity. Markets allow lenders to buy or sell their bonds to other investors long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date. There are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms. A bond's price changes daily, where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity, they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate.

Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies. A bond coupon, often known as the coupon rate, is the annual interest rate paid on a bond, expressed as a percentage of its face value. This fixed payment is made from the issue date until maturity. For instance, a bond with a 7% coupon rate and a $1,000 face value pays $70 annually, typically split into semiannual payments. The coupon rate remains constant, even if the bond's market price fluctuates before maturity. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol For example, a $1,000 bond with a coupon of 7% pays $70 a year. Typically, these interest payments are made twice a year, so the investor receives $35 each time. Because bonds can be traded before maturity, their market value can fluctuate, causing the current yield to differ from the coupon or nominal yield. You can calculate the bond's total annual payment easily using software such as Excel. For example, at issue, the $1,000 bond described above yields 7%; that is, its current and nominal yields are both 7%. If the bond later trades for $900, the current yield rises to 7.8% ($70 ÷ $900). The coupon rate, however, does not change, since it is a function of the annual payments and the face value, both of which are constant. Coupon rate or nominal yield = annual payments ÷ face value of the bond Current yield = annual payments ÷ market value of the bond The current yield helps calculate other metrics like yield to maturity and yield to worst.",

The yield of a stock, bond, or other asset is the earnings generated and realized on an investment over a period and includes the interest or dividends paid to investors. The yield of a stock, bond, or other asset is the amount of money its investors are paid. An investment's yield includes the interest it earns and/or the dividends paid to investors. Yield is expressed as a percentage based on the invested amount, the current market value, or the security's face value. Note that dividend yield is not the same as total return, which reflects any increase in the market value of the asset as well as the dividend payment. Investopedia / Ellen Lindner Yield is a measure of the profit an investor will be paid for investing in an asset. It is usually computed on an annual basis, although it may be paid quarterly or monthly. The gross yield is the return on the investment before taxes or other expenses. Yield (or net yield) should not be confused with total return, which is a more comprehensive measure of return on investment. Net yield is calculated as: For example, the gains and returns on stock investments can come in two forms. First, it can reflect a price increase, such as when an investor purchases a stock at $100 per share and, after a year, sells it for $120. Second, the stock may pay a dividend, say $2 per share, during the year. The yield would be the appreciation in the share price plus any dividends paid, divided by the original price of the stock. The yield for the example would be: A higher yield value indicates that an investor is getting more cash flow from holding an investment, but it's not that straightforward. Since dividends are paid from a company's profits, higher dividend payouts should mean the company's earnings are increasing, which could lead the stock's market price to rise.",

    "content": "A capital gains tax is imposed on the sale of an asset. The long-term capital gains tax rates for the 2025 tax year are 0%, 15%, or 20% of the profit, depending on the income of the filer. Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi Capital gains or profits are referred to as having been realized when stock shares or any other taxable investment assets are sold. The tax doesn't apply to unsold investments or unrealized capital gains. Stock shares won't incur taxes until they're sold, no matter how long they're held or how much they increase in value. The capital gains tax rate applies only to profits from the sale of assets held for more than a year, which is referred to as long-term capital gains. The rates are 0%, 15%, or 20% based on your annual income bracket, but collectibles are always taxed at 28%. Most taxpayers pay a higher rate on their income than on any long-term capital gains they may have realized. That gives them a financial incentive to hold investments for at least a year, after which the tax on the profit will be lower. Day traders and others taking advantage of the ease and speed of trading online should be aware that any profits they make from buying and selling assets held for less than a year aren't just taxed. They're taxed at a higher rate than assets that are held long-term. An investor will owe long-term capital gains tax on the profits of any investment they've owned for more than one year. Short-term capital gains apply to assets held for a year or less, and are taxed at your ordinary income rate. This is usually higher than the long-term capital gains rate for most people. The profit on an asset that's sold a year or less after its purchase is generally treated for tax purposes as if it were wages or salary. Such gains are added to your earned income or ordinary income on your tax return. The same generally applies to dividends. They represent profit, although they aren't capital gains. Ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income. Qualified dividends are subject to the 0%, 15%, or 20% capital gains tax. However, a different system applies to long-term capital gains. The tax you pay on assets held for more than a year and sold for a profit varies according to a rate schedule based on your taxable income. The rates are adjusted annually for inflation.",

These payments can make a stock more attractive to investors, but it may also signal that a company isn't doing enough to generate better returns. Investopedia / Julie Bang Dividends are a percentage of a company's earnings paid to its shareholders as their share of the profits. Dividends are generally paid quarterly, with the amount decided by the board of directors based on the company's most recent earnings. Dividends may be paid in cash or additional shares. When a company announces a dividend, it also announces the payment date on which the dividend will be paid into the shareholders' accounts. A dividend is a reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company, and it's usually paid out of the company's net profits. Some companies continue to make dividend payments even when their profits don't justify the expense. A steady track record of paying dividends makes stocks more attractive to investors. Various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also pay dividends. Dividends (for stocks) must be approved by the company's board of directors. In some cases, they also require shareholder approval. For funds, fund managers award dividends based on the fund's net asset value (NAV) and whether the fund receives dividends. Although cash dividends are most common, dividends can also be issued as shares of stock. A stock's dividend yield is the dividend paid per share and is expressed as a percentage of the company's share price, such as 2.5%. Common stock shareholders of dividend-paying companies can receive a distribution if they own the stock before the ex-dividend date. This is essentially a cutoff date for assigning the dividend payment when shares change hands. Dividends are paid on a schedule set by the board. They may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. Companies can also issue non-recurring special dividends, either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend. Not all companies pay dividends to common shareholders, but preferred share owners are guaranteed a set dividend.",

As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics. An individual retirement account (IRA)—known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS—is a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account that individuals with earned income can use to save for the future. The IRA is designed primarily for self-employed people who do not have access to workplace retirement accounts such as the 401(k), which is available only through employers. However, you can also have an IRA even if you already have a retirement plan at work. You can open an IRA through a bank, an investment company, an online brokerage, or a personal broker. Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin Anyone with earned income can open and contribute to an IRA, including those who have a 401(k) account through an employer. The only limitation is on the total that you can contribute to your retirement accounts in a single year. The best IRA accounts will offer the ability to invest in a wide range of financial products, including stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and mutual funds. There are also self-directed IRAs (SDIRAs) that permit investors to make all the investing decisions. SDIRAs offer access to a broader selection of investments, including real estate and commodities. Only the riskiest investments are off-limits. There are several kinds of IRAs, each with different rules regarding eligibility, taxation, and withdrawals. These types include: Individual taxpayers can establish traditional and Roth IRAs. Small business owners and self-employed individuals can set up SEP and SIMPLE IRAs.",

Jiaqi Zhou / Investopedia Creating a retirement plan begins with determining your long-term financial goals and tolerance for risk, and then starting to take action to reach those goals. The process can begin anytime during your working years, but the earlier, the better. The process of creating a retirement plan includes identifying your income sources, adding up your expenses, putting a savings plan into effect, and managing your assets. By estimating your future cash flows, you can judge whether your retirement income goal is realistic. Needless to say, a retirement plan is not a static document. You’ll need to update it from time to time as well as review it to monitor your progress. A retirement plan is your preparation for a good life after you’re done working to pay the bills or at least done working a full-time job. But it’s not all about money. The non-financial aspects include lifestyle choices such as how you want to spend your time in retirement and where you’ll live. A holistic approach to retirement planning considers all these areas. The goals for your retirement plan will change in focus over time: Some retirement plans change depending on where you are. The United States and Canada each have unique systems of workplace-sponsored plans.",

    "article_title": "What Is Asset Allocation, and Why Is It Important?",
    "content": "The term “asset allocation” refers to the process of dividing a financial or investment portfolio between different asset classes. Asset allocation is how investors divide their portfolios among different assets that might include equities, fixed-income assets, and cash and its equivalents. Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Joules Garcia / Investopedia There’s no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone, but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions that investors make. Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results. Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Someone saving to buy a new car in the next year might invest those savings in a conservative mix of cash, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds. However, individuals saving for retirement decades away typically invest most of their retirement accounts in stocks because they have a lot of time to ride out the market’s short-term fluctuations. Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. Those uncomfortable investing in stocks may put their money in a more conservative asset class despite having a long-term investment horizon. Financial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Cash and money market accounts are appropriate for goals less than a year away. Bonds fall somewhere in between. Financial advisors once recommended subtracting an investor's age from 100 to determine what percentage should be invested in stocks. A 40-year-old would, therefore, be 60% invested in stocks. Variations of this rule recommend subtracting age from 110 or 120, given that average life expectancy continues to grow. Portfolios should generally move to a more conservative asset allocation to help lower risk as individuals approach retirement. Some asset allocation mutual funds are known as life-cycle or target-date funds. They set out to provide investors with portfolios that address their age, risk appetite, and investment goals with the correlated parts of different asset classes. Critics of this approach point out that a standardized solution for allocating portfolio assets is wrongheaded because individual investors require individual solutions. These funds gradually reduce the risk in their portfolios as they near the target date, cutting riskier stocks and adding safer bonds to preserve the nest egg. The Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 (VTHRX) is an example of a target-date fund.",

Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street. Investopedia / Michela Buttignol Rebalancing is crucial for maintaining your portfolio's original asset allocation, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Market performance can shift asset values over time, necessitating periodic adjustments—selling overrepresented assets and buying underrepresented ones. Various strategies, such as calendar and constant-mix rebalancing, offer ways to manage these changes effectively, ensuring your investment stays on track for desired returns and risk levels. Rebalancing helps protect investors from unwanted risks while allowing for potential rewards. It also ensures that a portfolio stays within the manager’s area of expertise. There are times when a stock's price performance can vary more dramatically than that of bonds. Therefore, a portfolio's percentage of equity-related assets should be assessed as market conditions change. If the value of equities in a portfolio causes the allocation in stocks to rise above their preset percentage, a rebalancing may be in order. That would involve selling some shares of stock to lower the overall percentage of equities in the portfolio. Investors might adjust portfolio risk to meet changing financial goals. For instance, an investor who needs a greater potential for return might increase the allocation in assets that involve higher risk, such as equities, to improve that potential. Or, if income becomes more important than it was before, the allocation of bonds could be increased. Some investors may mistakenly understand rebalancing to refer to adjusting for an even distribution of assets. However, a 50%-50% stock and bond split is not required. A portfolio's target allocation of assets just as easily could be 70% stocks and 30% bonds, 40% stocks and 60% bonds, or 10% cash, 40% stocks, and 50% bonds. The allocation depends on the goals and needs of an investor. While there is no required schedule for rebalancing a portfolio, it's recommended that investors examine allocations at least once every year. Investors don't have to rebalance but generally, that's ill-advised.",

    "content": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT). Market risk refers to the potential for financial loss due to fluctuations in the market. The term market risk refers to the potential for losses that may arise from financial market fluctuations. Put simply, it is the risk of market price and interest rate movements. Market risk, which is also called systematic risk, is often the result of market prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and other factors. Regardless of what an investor does, market risk cannot be avoided or eliminated but it can be mitigated through different strategies. Investopedia / Yurle Villegas As noted above, market risk is the potential that entities may experience for financial losses stemming from changes in market prices. The standard deviation of changes in the prices of stocks, currencies, or commodities is referred to as price volatility. Volatility is often presented in annualized terms and may be expressed as an absolute number, such as $10, or a percentage of the initial value, such as 10%. Various factors can affect market risk, including recessions, political turmoil, changes in interest rates, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. Systematic risk, which is another term for market risk, tends to influence the entire market at the same time. Although you can't eliminate market risk, you can mitigate or manage it using different investment strategies, including: Publicly traded companies in the United States are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose how their productivity and results may be linked to the performance of the financial markets. This requirement is meant to detail a company’s exposure to financial risk. For example, a company providing derivative investments or foreign exchange futures may be more exposed to financial risk than companies that do not provide these types of investments. This information helps investors and traders make decisions based on their own risk management rules. Market risk can be contrasted with unsystematic risk, Unlike market risk, unsystematic risk is unique to a specific company or industry. Also known as nonsystematic risk, specific risk, diversifiable risk, or residual risk, it can be mitigated through diversification. One example of unsystematic risk is a company declaring bankruptcy, thereby making its stock worthless to investors. The most common types of market risks include interest rate risk, equity risk, currency risk, and commodity risk.",

    "content": "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a strategy that can make it easier to deal with uncertain markets by making purchases automatic. Investing can be challenging, as even experienced investors who try to time the market can come up short. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that removes the uncertainty of market timing by adhering to a fixed investment schedule. It also supports an investor’s effort to invest regularly. DCA involves investing the same amount of money in a target security at regular intervals over a certain period, regardless of price. By using DCA, investors may lower their average cost per share and reduce the impact of volatility on their portfolios. In effect, this strategy eliminates the effort required when attempting to time the market to buy at the best prices. Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a simple tool that an investor can use to build savings and wealth over the long term. It's also a way for an investor to ignore short-term volatility in the broader markets. A prime example of long-term DCA is its use in 401(k) plans, in which employees invest regularly regardless of the price of the investment. With a 401(k) plan, employees can choose the amount they wish to contribute as well as the investments offered by the plan in which to invest. Then, investments are made automatically every pay period. Depending on the markets, employees might see a larger or smaller number of securities added to their accounts. DCA can also be used outside of 401(k) plans. For instance, investors can use it to make regular purchases of mutual or index funds, whether in another tax-advantaged account like a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) or a taxable brokerage account. DCA is one of the best strategies for beginning investors looking to trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, many dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) allow investors to dollar-cost average by making purchases regularly. DCA is also known as the constant dollar plan. The investment strategy of DCA can be used by any investor who wants to take advantage of its benefits. DCA may be especially useful to beginning investors who don’t yet have the experience or expertise to judge the most opportune moments to buy. It can also be a reliable strategy for long-term investors who are committed to investing regularly but don't have the time or inclination to watch the market and time their orders.",

    "content": "A mutual fund is a financial vehicle in which shareholders put their money together to invest in securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, money market instruments). A fund manager chooses the best investments, and every investor shares in the profits if the investments do well. A mutual fund gathers money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. For millions of Americans, these funds are the cornerstone of their retirement savings, offering professional management and built-in diversification that would be difficult to achieve on their own. In a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings. When you invest in a mutual fund, you’re essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the fund’s stated objectives—whether that’s aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index. Ellen Lindner / Investopedia Mutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all of the fund’s underlying assets. The fund’s performance depends on its assets—if it’s full of stocks going up, it will go up. If they’re going down, so will the fund. A mutual fund decides how to divide money across sectors, industries, and companies based on its strategy. Many funds are index or passive funds, so they don't need a lot of hands-on management. They mirror assets of indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The biggest fund managers are Vanguard and Fidelity. The reason mutual funds are so often the default for retirement accounts like 401(k)s is that they let you instantly diversify across hundreds of securities with a relatively modest amount of money. Mutual fund investment increased significantly since they were introduced about half a century ago, from about 6% of American households in 1980 to about 54% in 2024, including about 35% of Gen Z households. Together, American households owned about 88% of all mutual fund assets as of the end of 2024.",

The firm has traditionally avoided a regular slate of live programming or sports content, instead focusing on on-demand access to episodic television, movies, and documentaries.  The firm introduced ad-supported subscription plans in 2022, giving the firm exposure to the advertising market in addition to the subscription fees that have historically accounted for nearly all its revenue. Alphabet is a holding company that wholly owns internet giant Google. The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales. Alongside online ads, Google services houses sales stemming from Google’s subscription services (YouTube TV and YouTube Music, among others), platforms (sales and in-app purchases on Play Store), and devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products such as Chromecast). Google’s cloud computing platform accounts for roughly 10% of Alphabet’s revenue. The firm’s investments in up-and-coming technologies such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health (Verily), and internet access (Google Fiber) make up the rest.",
